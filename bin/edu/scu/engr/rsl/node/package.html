  Provides an application interface for reading data from a sensor system, connected 
  to a computer COM port, and publishing this data to a DataTurbine channel. 
  
  <P>
  This package provides a high-level console interface that establishes a connection 
  to a COM port and a DataTurbin channel. The console application requires some 
  initial configuration to setup the desired COM port and to establish a 
  channel on the DataTurbine that a client application will read data from.
